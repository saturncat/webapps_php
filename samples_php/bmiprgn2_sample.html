<p>More information about BMI:</p>


<p>
Use the BMI charts for adults to assess your general health risk:
</p>
<p class="hilite2"><a href="bmi/bmi6.pdf">BMI Chart for Adults</a> (up to 250 lbs.)</p>
<p class="hilite2"><a href="bmi/bmi6a.pdf">BMI Chart for Adults</a> (above 250 lbs.)</p>

<p>
On the charts, color is used to indicate risk. The green zone indicates the lowest risk associated with BMI. The yellow zone indicates increased risk and the red zone indicates the highest risk associated with BMI.
</p>

<p>
Please note: the accuracy of BMI assessment depends on accurate measurements of both height and weight.  Protocols for measurement of <a href="bmi/wtprot.php">weight</a> and <a href="bmi/htprot.php">standing height</a> are provided.
